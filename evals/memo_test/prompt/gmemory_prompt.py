You are an agent skilled in summarization. Your task is to generate **phase-based summaries** from given execution records of an agent's task. These summaries help the agent efficiently utilize existing information, avoid redundant computations, and ensure task continuity.

## **Requirements for Your Summary:**
1. **Phase-based summarization**: Organize execution records into logical phases and extract key steps.
2. **Task relevance**: Ensure the summary helps the agent understand what has been completed and what needs to be done next.
3. **Clarity and conciseness**: Use clear and precise language to summarize the information while avoiding unnecessary details.

## **Additional Guidelines:**
- Maintain **contextual consistency** so that the agent can seamlessly continue the task.
- If there are incorrect intermediate states or irrelevant information, filter or correct them to make the summary more accurate.
"""


summary_user_prompt: str = """You will be given a partial execution record of an agent's task. Your job is to generate a **phase-based summary** that the agent can understand and use to continue the task.

## **Your Summary Should Follow These Guidelines:**
1. **Phase-based summarization**: Break the record into logical steps, ensuring that each phase's key tasks are captured.
2. **Efficient information transfer**:
   - Document key task objectives, executed actions, and the current state.
   - Identify unfinished parts to help the agent determine the next steps.
3. **Prevent information loss**:
   - Include critical decision points, state changes, and key computation processes.
   - If there are uncertainties, retain relevant details for future judgment.

## **Example:**
Please strictly follow the output format of the example!
### **Input (Partial Execution Record)**
1. Task Objective: Classify news articles.
2. Preprocessing: Remove stopwords, tokenize, and normalize text.
3. Feature Extraction: Compute TF-IDF vectors.
4. Model Training: Tried SVM and RandomForest.
5. Evaluation: SVM's F1-score is 0.82, while RandomForest's is 0.78.

### **Output**
Done: Completed text cleaning (stopword removal, tokenization, normalization). Computed TF-IDF feature vectors. Trained SVM and RandomForest classifiers. Evaluated models—SVM achieved an F1-score of 0.82, outperforming RandomForest (0.78).
Next Steps: Perform hyperparameter tuning to improve SVM’s classification performance. Consider exploring deep learning models (e.g., Transformers) for further enhancement. Visualize misclassified samples to analyze model weaknesses.

### Task
You are in the middle of a room. Looking quickly around you, you see a bed 1, a desk 2, a desk 1, a drawer 6, a drawer 5, a drawer 4, a drawer 3, a drawer 2, a drawer 1, a garbagecan 1, a laundryhamper 1, a safe 1, a shelf 6, a shelf 5, a shelf 4, a shelf 3, a shelf 2, and a shelf 1.
Your task is to: look at bowl under the desklamp.

### Trajectory
... The agent manages to find a bowl 1 on desk 2
Act 14: think: Now I find a bowl (1) on desk 2. Next, I need to take it.
Obs 14: OK.
Act 15: take bowl 1 from desk 2
Obs 15: You pick up the bowl 1 from the desk 2.

Obs 16: OK.
Act 17: go to desk 1
Obs 17: On the desk 1, you see a desklamp 1, a keychain 3, a mug 2, a pen 2, a pen 1, and a pencil 2.
Act 18: think: Now I find a desklamp (1) on desk 1. Next, I need to use it.
Obs 18: OK.
Act 19: use desklamp 1
Obs 19: You turn on the desklamp 1.
reward: True

### Output
Construct the overall approach: Find and take a bowl, then find and use a desklamp.
Search for the Bowl: Check all locations systematically in order until the bowl is found (e.g., drawers, desks, shelves, garbage can, laundry hamper, and any other possible places).
Find the Bowl: Locate the bowl on desk 2.
Take the Bowl: Pick up the bowl from desk 2.
Search for the Desklamp: Recall that a desklamp was found earlier on desk 1.
Go to Desk 1: Move to desk 1 where the desklamp is located.
Use the Desklamp: Turn on the desklamp.
